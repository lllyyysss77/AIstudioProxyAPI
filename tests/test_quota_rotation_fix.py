"""
Test to verify the fix for quota rotation stream termination issue.

This test simulates the exact scenario from the bug report:
1. Quota exceeded triggers rotation
2. Rotation completes successfully
3. Stream receives empty DONE signal (Body=0, Reason=0)
4. System should NOT complete the stream, but ignore the stale DONE

The fix ensures that post-rotation empty DONE signals are properly
identified as stale zombie packets and ignored.
