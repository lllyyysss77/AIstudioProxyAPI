## Code Style

We use:

- **Ruff** for linting and formatting
- **Pyright** for type checking
- **80% test coverage** minimum for modified files

See [Development Guide](docs/development-guide.md) for detailed coding conventions.

## CI/CD & GitHub Workflows

We use GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and manage releases.

### 1. PR Checks
Triggered on every Pull Request and push to `main`. Your PR **must** pass these checks to be merged:
- **Linting**: `ruff check .`
- **Type Checking**: `pyright`
- **Tests**: `pytest`

**Tip:** Run these checks locally before submitting to avoid CI failures:
```bash
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run pyright
poetry run pytest
```

### 2. Upstream Sync
Runs daily at 00:00 UTC to sync with the [upstream repository](https://github.com/CJackHwang/AIstudioProxyAPI).
- Creates a Pull Request automatically if new upstream commits are found.
- Can be triggered manually via the **Actions** tab.

### 3. Release Process
Automates release creation.
- **Trigger**: Push a tag (e.g., `v4.0.6`) or trigger manually via **Actions**.
- **Action**: Creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated changelog and source archives.

To create a release:
```bash
git tag v4.0.6
git push origin v4.0.6
```
