# PR Check Workflow
# Runs linting, type checking, and tests on pull requests and pushes to main
#
# NOTE: Lint and type check are set to continue-on-error because this is a fork
# of an upstream project with pre-existing code quality issues. These jobs will
# report issues but won't block the workflow from completing successfully.
# As code quality improves, these can be made blocking again.
#
# CACHING STRATEGY:
# - Poetry virtualenv: Cached per OS/Python version/poetry.lock hash
# - Pip cache: Cached per OS/Python version for faster package resolution
# - Playwright browsers: Cached per OS/Playwright version (test job only)
